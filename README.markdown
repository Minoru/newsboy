newsboy
=======

Newsboy is an Atom/RSS feeds fetcher. It acts as a proxy for your reader, and
will keep fetching the feeds you've requested lately, caching them so you don't
miss a single tidbit.

Installation
------------

At the moment, the only way to install newsboy is to build it from the source.
The only requirement is a [`stack`](http://haskellstack.org) utility.

Run `stack install` in the directory with `newsboy`'s source code, and `newsboy`
executable will be installed into `~/.local/bin` (you can run `stack path
--local-bin-path` to check this path).
